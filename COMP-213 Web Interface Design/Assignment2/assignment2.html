	<h3 id="importance";>Importance of Tiger Reserves</h3>

		<p>The need to protect tiger reserves cannot be emphasized enough. From an ecological perspective, tigers play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. They are apex predators and help control the population of herbivores, which in turn helps regulate vegetation growth. Furthermore, tigers are an indicator species, which means that their presence or absence can reflect the overall health of the ecosystem. In addition to their ecological importance, tigers also hold cultural and spiritual significance for many communities.

	<h3 id="reasons";>Reasons why protecting tiger reserves is crucial</h3>
		<ul style="list-style-image:url(animated-check-bullet-4.gif);">
			<li><b>Habitat loss:</b> Tigers need large areas of contiguous forest to survive. However, rampant deforestation and habitat fragmentation have led to a significant reduction in tiger habitat. Protecting tiger reserves can help ensure that these habitats are conserved and that tigers have a safe haven.
			</li>
			<li><b>Illegal wildlife trade:</b> Tigers are poached for their skin, bones, and other body parts, which are in high demand in some countries for their supposed medicinal properties. Protecting tiger reserves can help reduce the demand for tiger products and curb poaching.
			</li>
			<li><b>Human-tiger conflict:</b> As human populations expand into tiger habitats, there is an increased likelihood of conflict between humans and tigers. Protecting tiger reserves can help mitigate this conflict by providing alternative livelihoods for local communities and implementing measures to reduce human-tiger interactions.
			</li>
			<li><b>Tourism:</b> Tiger reserves can be a significant source of revenue for local communities through wildlife tourism. However, it is essential to ensure that this tourism is sustainable and does not have a negative impact on the tigers and their habitat.

	<img src="india.jpg" alt ="Tiger India" style="float:left; margin-left:8px" height="180" width="300">	
	<p>Project Tiger is a wildlife conservation movement initiated in India in 1973 to protect the Bengal tiger.

		During the tiger census of 2006, a new methodology was used extrapolating site-specific densities of tigers, their co-predators and prey derived from camera trap and sign surveys using GIS. Based on the result of these surveys, the total tiger population was estimated at 1,411 individuals ranging from 1,165 to 1,657 adult and sub-adult tigers of more than 1.5 years of age. <p>It was claimed that owing to the project, the number of tigers increased to 2,603–3,346 individuals by 2018. In 2023, the 55th tiger reserve in India was declared in Dholpur-Karauli, Rajasthan, being the State’s fifth tiger reserve.

	<img src="malaysia.jpg" alt ="Tiger malaysia" style="float:right; margin-left:8px" height="180" width="300">	
		<p>Save The Malayan Tiger is a Malaysian conservation campaign under the esteemed leadership of His Royal Highness The Regent of Pahang, Crown Prince Tengku Hassanal Ibrahim Alam Shah Ibni Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah. Our primary mission is twofold: to foster public awareness and to protect the endangered Malayan tigers within their vital natural habitat.

		<p>By saving the Malayan tigers, we are not only fulfilling our duty to protect our nation's rich biodiversity but also safeguarding the essential natural resources that sustain our ecosystem. These majestic creatures are not just symbolic of our nation's heritage; they play a pivotal role in maintaining the ecological balance of our forests.

	<h3 id="china";>China's effort to bring Tigers back</h3>
	<img src="china.jpg" alt ="Tiger china" style="float:left; margin-left:8px" height="180" width="280">	
	<p>Save China's Tigers has taken on an ambitious project to bring the South China tiger back from the edge of extinction by taking them out of zoos, breeding them, letting them regain their hunting abilities and reintroducing them back to the wild in China.
	</p>
	<p>The Project is one of the first for the Chinese government and their conservation initiatives.  The effort draws on the skills and experience of scientists from southern Africa, and throughout the world,who have worked successfully in bringing other species back from the brink of extinction.

	<h3 id="future";>Future of Tiger Reserves</h3>
	<img src="winfortiger1.jpg" alt ="wintiger" style="float:right; margin-left:auto margin-right:auto" height="360" width="600">	
		<p>The future of tiger reserves is a crucial aspect that needs to be considered for the long-term survival of this magnificent species. It is essential to look at this issue from different points of view, including the government, conservationists, and local communities. The government's role is to ensure that policies and laws are put in place to protect these reserves and their inhabitants.<p> Conservationists play a crucial role in monitoring the tiger population, ensuring that their habitats are preserved, and educating the public about the importance of these reserves. Local communities are also essential stakeholders as they live in and around these reserves and are directly impacted by conservation efforts.
